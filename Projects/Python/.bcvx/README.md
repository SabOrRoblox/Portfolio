Hello dear friend, this is my project on Python.
get to the point:
Usage examples:
```bash
# Encrypt
./crypt.sh encrypt secret.txt '@MkJ#$^10?kJpI'
./crypt.sh e secret.txt '@MkJ#$^10?kJpI'

# Decrypt
./crypt.sh decrypt secret_enc.bcvx '@MkJ#$^10?kJpI'
./crypt.sh d secret_enc.bcvx '@MkJ#$^10?kJpI'

# Help
./crypt.sh help
```
but first make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x crypt.sh
```
